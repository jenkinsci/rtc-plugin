Load rules for the view, which specify the path names of directories to load from the component. Multiple load rules can be specified on multiple lines. Do not use file names, this will fail.
<br/><br/>
An individual load rule can specify a directory but not a file. A load rule that specifies a directory loads the directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories). To load all resources in a component, create a load rule that specifies the root directory of the component.
<br/><br/>
Example: widgetM3:/src/main/enterprise/openapplications/v1/extensions
<br/><br/>
In the example widgetM3 is the component and /src/main/enterprise/openapplications/v1/extensions is a folder within the widgetM3 component to load.
<br/><br/>
For dynamic views, the load rules will be used to determine the paths to search in for changes.
